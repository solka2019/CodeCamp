# Activities 
Practicing HTML
In this HTML, the image was added inside the anchor tag to become a link.
The images were saved in my computer and added to <img src=...>

## To remember
the <img> tag does not have a closing tag
<img> needs width and lenght to adjust on the page
the <a> tag has a closing tag
<a> tag used the href attribute
<br> can distance the image from the text, no need of CSS yet

## Practice Bash
created mkdir, Git folder, repo - add, commit, push

## To improve
add <video> tag next time
how to add random paragraph to test the page
